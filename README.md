# Library-Management-System

Developed a console-based Library Management System using core Java concepts. The system allows adding and managing books and users, issuing and returning books, and displaying the current book and user lists.

Implemented validation checks to avoid re-issuing or returning unissued books.

Used ArrayList to store and manage dynamic collections of books and users.
